The Dockerfile is relatively straightforward. It starts from alpine image, sets the working directory, copies a file into the container, and sets a command to run when the container starts.

The corresponding Earthfile might look like this:
```Earthfile
VERSION 0.7
WORKDIR /bash
FROM alpine:latest

docker:
  COPY ./hello.md .
  CMD ["/bin/sh"]
  SAVE IMAGE --push bash-image

all:
  BUILD +docker
```

Note that the image name is just a place holder name choosen for now. As image name information hasn't been seen yet. 

Next, let's look at the relevant GitHub Actions workflow sections.

```yaml
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Build the Docker image
      run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag xyz7:$(date +%s)
```

This workflow tags the image as `xyz7:$(date +%s)`. We can make that change in the Earthfile but introducing an `ARG` and changing the `SAVE IMAGE` in the docker target.

```Earthfile
docker:
  ARG date=$(date +%s)
  COPY ./hello.md .
  CMD ["/bin/sh"]
  SAVE IMAGE --push my-xyz7:$date
```

In summary, the Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow can be converted to an Earthfile. The Earthfile defines the steps to build the Docker image, and running `earthly +docker` or `earthly +all` builds and tags the image.
