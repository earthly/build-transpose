In your case, you want to merge the python Earthfile and alpine and busybox Earthfile. They both have targets named `build` so we will have to rename `build` in the second file to `alpine-build`. Also they both have different base images so `alpine-build` in the second file we will need to introduce a `FROM alpine:3.15` and drop the preable that is the first couple lines of that Earthfile. 

Additionally, the first Earthfile has an `all` target, which should probably cover all steps across both files, so we should add `another` to that.

Here is the merged Earthfile.

```Earthfile
VERSION 0.7
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app

deps:
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  COPY src/ src/

build:
  FROM +deps
  RUN pip install pylint pytest  

runner:
  FROM +deps
  CMD ["python", "src/run.py"]
  SAVE IMAGE --push user/app:latest

analyze:
  FROM +build
  RUN pylint $(find src/ -name '*.py') 
  RUN pytest

alpine-build:
    FROM alpine:3.15
    RUN echo "word" > ./a-file
    SAVE ARTIFACT ./a-file

another:
    FROM busybox
    COPY +alpine-build/a-file .
    SAVE IMAGE something

all:
  BUILD +runner
  BUILD +analyze
  BUILD +another
```
