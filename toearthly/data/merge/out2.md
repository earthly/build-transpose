In your case, you want to merge one python Earthfile and a second pythong Earthilfe that are very similar. `deps` and `build` are identical in both files, so can be include just once. 
`runner` in the first file is the same as `docker` in the second file and so we can include those just one those the name `docker`, since `docker` is more descriptive of what it does.
`analyze` can be included unchanged. 
`all` should be updated to include `analyze` and use the new name `docker`.


Here is the merged Earthfile.

```Earthfile
VERSION 0.7
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app

deps:
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  COPY src/ src/

build:
  FROM +deps
  RUN pip install pylint pytest  

docker:
  FROM +deps
  CMD ["python", "src/run.py"]
  SAVE IMAGE --push user/app:latest

analyze:
  FROM +build
  RUN pylint $(find src/ -type f -name '*.py') 
  RUN pytest

all:
  BUILD +docker
  BUILD +analyze
```
