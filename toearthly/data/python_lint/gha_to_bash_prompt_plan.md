1. Create a `run.sh` script that will be responsible for building and running the Docker container. This script will be stored in the git repository along with the code.

2. Create a `build.Dockerfile` that will define the base image and install the necessary dependencies for the build process. In this case, we need a base image with Python 3.10, pip, flake8, and pytest.

3. Create a `build.sh` script that will run the actual build steps inside the Docker container. This script will be executed within the `build.Dockerfile` image.

Now, let's go through the YAML file section by section:

- The `on` section specifies when the workflow should run. This is not relevant for our bash and Docker setup, so we can ignore it.

- The `permissions` section is also not relevant for our setup, so we can ignore it.

- The `jobs` section contains the actual build steps. We will need to adapt these steps for our `build.sh` and `build.Dockerfile` files.

  - The `actions/checkout@v3` step is not needed, as our `run.sh` and `build.sh` scripts will be stored in the git repository along with the code.

  - The `actions/setup-python@v3` step should be included in the `build.Dockerfile`. We need to use a base image with Python 3.10 installed.

  - The "Install dependencies" step should be included in the `build.Dockerfile`. We need to install pip, flake8, and pytest in the image. Additionally, we should copy the `requirements.txt` file into the image and install the dependencies listed in it.

  - The "Lint with flake8" step should be included in the `build.sh` script. We will run the flake8 commands as specified in the YAML file.

  - The "Test with pytest" step should also be included in the `build.sh` script. We will run the pytest command as specified in the YAML file.
