        I need your help to merge Earthfiles.
        If the files have different base `FROM`s, you'll have to include the `FROM`
        statements in the targets where needed,
        You should also add any missing steps to the `all` target if any exists.
        If two steps do the same thing, but with different target names, they can
        be combined.

        First Earthfile:
        Project: {{this.name1}}
        ```Earthfile
        {{this.file1}}
        ```

        Second Earthfile:
        Project: {{this.name2}}
        ```Earthfile
        {{this.file2}}

        If the have different bases, we will have to include the `FROM` statements in
        the targets where needed and we should also add any missing steps to the `all`
        target.

        Please discuss the way to merge these two files and then give the merged file
        in backticks.
